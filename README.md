These are just two simple python scripts that read a PLC program (AB or S7) and create some python code to read each tag. 

- The code generated is intended to be used with the python libraries pycomm (AB) or snap7 (Siemens). 
- The only input required is the PLC project file exported as txt.
- It would probably be easier to separate the code into blocks and put it into a ipython notebook.
